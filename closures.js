//Once you complete a problem, open up Chrome and check the answer in the console.

//Above you're given a function that returns another function which has a closure over the name variable.
//Invoke outer saving the return value into another variable called 'inner'.

//Once you do that, invoke inner.

/*
  Write a function called makeCounter that makes the following code work properly.
*/

  //Code Here
  var count = makeCounter();
  count(); // 1
  count(); // 2
  count(); // 3
  count(); // 4



//Next Problem



/*
  Write a function named codeLove that returns the string 'I love code'. Write a second function named codeFriend that accepts the first function as it's first parameter. The second function should return a new third function. Store the third function in a variable, codeEcho which, when invoked, invokes the first, original function that was passed in, but will only ever do so once (returns null after first invocation).
*/

  //Code Here



//Next Problem



/*
  Now, similar to the last problem, write a function called 'fnCounter' that accepts two parameters. The first parameter will be an anonymous function and the second parameter, 'N', will be a number. Now, in 'fnCounter', allow the anonymous funciton to be invoked 'N' number of times. After it's been invoked 'N' number of times, return 'STOP'.
*/



//Next Problem



/*
  var counter = function(){
    for (var i=1; i<=5; i++) {
      setTimeout( function timer(){
          console.log( i );
      }, i*1000 );

  };

  Above you have a function named counter. Examine the function (without running the code) then below write what you expect to happen when the funciton is invoked. *Hint: setTimeout calls a function or evaluates an expression after a specified number of milliseconds.

    //Answer Here


  Now, run the function in your console and note what happpens.

  Was your answer right or wrong?

    //Answer Here


  Fix the counter function so that it works the way you expect it to work. (logging 1 then 2 then 3, etc) (Note: No unit test for this one because of the timeout)
